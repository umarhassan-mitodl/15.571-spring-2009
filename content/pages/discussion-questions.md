Managing change

Guest speaker: Cyrus Gibson, MIT Sloan CISR

Case: Aetna


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


1\. Describe the business and IT changes at Aetna, from 2001 to 2006, using the relevant terms and frameworks of this course.

2\. How were the changes accomplished? Characterize the condition of the company and make some qualitative inferences about its culture, values, and work behavior in 2001 as compared to 2006. What particular actions and management style by Ron Williams and others appear to have helped the culture change? What were the risks? What were the critical things that had to go right for success?

3\. During the first three years Ron Williams managed the business very closely and tightly, convening and running virtually all executive meetings including all significant IT decisions. What is required to ensure that the success after four years can be sustained, as Williams succeeds John Rowe and will be expected to turn much of his attention to external constituencies and issues?

4\. What achievements and lessons from the Aetna turnaround are relevant to planning and executing the Federal Government's expenditure of $20 billion on healthcare IT as part of the economic stimulus package?
